      "One Week $50 ALDI Meal Plan By Tiffany Published March 6, 2024 • Last Updated: March 6, 2024 99 Comments This one-week $50 ALDI meal plan lets you get everything you need at one store! Use this Aldi budget meal planner to enjoy yummy family-friendly recipes like the Best Burgers Ever and Baked Potato Nachos, plus plenty of fresh veggies, so you can feel good about feeding your family on a budget. Here at Crumbs, we’re all about eating real food on a budget. I encourage you to do things like shop in bulk, consider NOT using coupons, and use tricks to save on meat at the store. But sometimes it’s not HOW you shop, but WHERE you shop that makes the biggest difference. Shopping at the wrong store might be a reason you’re NOT saving money on food! Case in point – check out my side-by-side comparisons of ALDI vs. Costco, and ALDI vs. Walmart! Knowing how to shop strategically to slash your grocery budget comes with years of experience (or you can get there faster by taking my course!). But as you build your shopping experience, you can “hack” your strategy by creating a meal plan that lets you buy everything you need from one store. Not just any store though – a store that is known for their low prices…like ALDI. Psst! If you think shopping for deals means spending all day driving all over town, you’re wrong! Let me teach you how to shop quickly, and still get everything you need. Enrollment for my course Grocery Budget Bootcamp opens just a few times each year, and graduates save anywhere from $200 – $300 in the first month alone! Enrollment is currently closed, but you can join my FREE 5-day Crush Inflation Challenge and start saving money on groceries tomorrow! BUDGET MEAL PLANNER ALDI It’s also no secret that I’m a big advocate of meal planning. I have TONS of free meal plans on the blog. But would you believe that I’ve never specifically made a budget meal planner Aldi style? Let’s change that. Today, our focus is on a week of Aldi dinner ideas. ONE WEEK ALDI BUDGET MEAL PLAN WHAT’S INCLUDED: 100% real food recipes that are simple, straightforward, and family-friendly. Easy family recipes that are quick to make and all of them can be made in under an hour. A few store-bought items for things I typically make from scratch (like hamburger buns and spaghetti sauce). Feel free to make these things from scratch if you prefer. One week of Aldi dinner ideas that comes in right at $50 for a family of four! WHAT’S NOT INCLUDED: Spices, salt and pepper, olive oil, and vinegar. None of these Aldi recipes call for enormous amounts of these things, and you probably already have these pantry staples. Flour. Ordinarily, I’d include this, especially if we were doing a lot of baking. But this week, we’re skipping the baking, and you only need a couple of tablespoons for the meatballs. Most pantries have some sort of flour, but if you don’t, I’d ask a neighbor, or use a substitute like oats or breadcrumbs! Precautions for food allergies. My family is blessed to not have food allergies, so I don’t plan for them in my meal plans. However, ALDI has a fantastic gluten-free line of foods (and this ALDI meal plan is mostly gluten-free already), and if you’re dairy-free you’re used to subbing anyway. With a few tweaks, I think this ALDI meal plan would work in most food allergy families too. NO BREAKFAST OR LUNCHES? This meal plan doesn’t include breakfast or lunches because, in my experience, most families have personal preferences on what they eat for breakfast and lunch. Have no fear though – I have NO DOUBT the ingredients you buy for this meal plan will provide extras you can use to cover breakfasts and/or lunches. Here’s why: Every main dish in this Aldi budget meal planner is something I make frequently with my family. Every single one of them covers dinner for the four of us AND enough for at least one leftover lunch (usually two). Use the “Bonus Meal Ideas” section at the bottom to create your own breakfast and lunch menu. Those are just some ideas to get started, but they’re there to help you use the ingredients you’re already buying! If you still don’t think this is enough food to cover breakfast AND lunches, buy a bag of apples and a container of oatmeal. Make apple cinnamon oatmeal or granola for breakfast and you’ll still keep your total bill under $55. $50 ALDI Meal Plan Sign up to get instant access to my $50 ALDI Meal Plan, complete with recipes and shopping list!

They were taken from an Aldi location outside of Atlanta just before publishing. The total cost in your area may be different!! I highly suggest… Shopping from your pantry first and substituting with as many things as possible where necessary to keep your Aldi shopping list as short as possible. Use your price book to find the rock-bottom prices in your area. Look at other stores like Walmart and Costco! I did side-by-side cost comparisons of ALDI vs. Walmart and ALDI vs. Costco and you might be surprised at what I found out! Remember, you’ll likely have extras of some ingredients! Use the Bonus Aldi Meal Ideas section below for ideas on additional recipes to make. ONE WEEK ALDI MEAL PLAN: WHAT TO BUY The goal with any of my meal plans is to buy as little food as possible, use everything you buy, and do both without sacrificing taste or quality. Without further ado, then, here’s what you’re buying for this free Aldi meal plan: MEAT Ground Beef 80/20, $3.99/lb: You’ll need two pounds of this to cover hamburgers and meatballs. My recipe for meatballs makes A LOT of meatballs, and we always have leftovers. Save the extras for a lunch or freeze them for a future dinner. Bacon, $3.79/lb: One pound of bacon is getting split between the Baked Potato Nachos and BLT’s. Be sure to save the bacon grease for cooking – it’s great for adding bacon flavor to just about anything (try it in my Caramelized Onions and Swiss Chard recipe)! Chicken Leg Quarters, $0.89/lb: You need about 1 ¼ pounds of chicken leg quarters to equal 4 cups of shredded chicken. You’ll use this chicken in the Southwestern Chicken Chopped Salad and Chicken Fried Rice. Depending on your package, you might have extra chicken for lunches, or to freeze for a future dinner! MEAT TOTAL: $12.66 COLD CASE Cheddar Cheese, $1.79/8 oz: You need 12 ounces for this meal plan, so you’ll end up with an extra 4 ounces of cheddar cheese by the end of the week. Personally, I’d shred it and freeze it in 2-ounce portions – that’s the perfect amount to use in a taco bar! Eggs, $1.29/dozen: This meal plan only calls for 2 eggs, so you’ll have several left over. Save them for the following week, use them for breakfast, or use the “Bonus Meal Ideas” below for more ideas! Sour Cream, $1.69/16 oz: Sour cream is a topping for Tortilla Soup and Baked Potato Nachos, but you can also add it to your Southwestern Chicken Chopped Salad too. If you serve spaghetti and meatballs at the end of the week, add leftover sour cream to the sauce for a fun twist on pasta night! Frozen Veggies, $1.19/16 oz: You’ll need one bag of mixed vegetables for Chicken Fried Rice, and one bag of corn for Southwestern Chicken Chopped Salad and Tortilla Soup. You could use fresh for the fried rice, but this is a shortcut to help you save time without sacrificing quality! COLD CASE TOTAL: $8.94 PANTRY Black Beans, 59¢/15 oz: You need one can of black beans for this Aldi menu, which will get split between Tortilla Soup and Southwestern Chopped Salad. Be sure to drain them well and rinse them twice to avoid gas! Garbanzo Beans, 59¢/15 oz: Just like the black beans, you need one can to split for two meals this week. Note: If you decide to cook dry beans instead, you can shave off a few cents per “can.” See the math when I compared dry vs canned beans! Plus, it’s SUPER easy to make beans in the Instant Pot, portion them out, and stick the extras in the freezer for future meals. Chicken Broth, $1.89/32 oz: I normally make a big batch of chicken broth using leftover chicken bones, but since not everyone does that, I put chicken broth on the shopping list. You need the entire quart for Tortilla Soup. If you prefer your soup to have more liquid, add some water without sacrificing the flavor. Ranch Dressing, $.89/16 oz: This is something else I personally typically make from scratch (here’s the recipe), but this might not be the case for everyone. We’re having salad 4 nights this week AND we’re using the dressing for dipping one night. If you have family members who are liberal with dressing, make sure they don’t go overboard too early in the week! Rice, $1.29/2 lbs: You only need 2 cups of cooked rice for one meal this week, so you’re definitely going to have leftovers with this purchase. That’s fine though, because rice stores well AND is a perfect side dish to almost any meal! Soy Sauce, $1.49/10 oz: Soy sauce is a staple in Chicken Fried Rice, and while you won’t use the entire jar, fried rice isn’t the same without it! Lucky for us, soy sauce won’t go bad sitting on the pantry shelf. Spaghetti Pasta, $1.45/2 lbs: You really only need 8 ounces for the Spaghetti and Meatballs this week, but you could bump it up to a full pound and still have enough spaghetti leftover for another meal! Spaghetti Sauce, $.99/24 oz: I normally make my own spaghetti sauce. Whether I go all out for Hearty Spaghetti Sauce or keep it minimal with a 15-Minute Sauce, it’s just something I prefer to make myself. In case you don’t, it’s something to buy on this week’s Aldi run for Spaghetti and Meatballs. Fortunately, it’s very affordable! Sunflower Seeds, $1.99/10.5 oz: Sunflower seeds might not seem that important, but I like the crunch they add to salads. And since we’re having several salads this week, this isn’t something to skip! Canned Diced Tomatoes, 87¢/15 oz: We need one can of diced tomatoes for Tortilla Soup. If you find a variety that’s fire-roasted or has added chiles, pick it up for a fun twist on this delicious recipe! PANTRY TOTAL: $12.04 PRODUCE Avocado, $1.59/each: This isn’t cheap for one avocado, but I’m including it because it’s a healthy fat for us. It also helps to make Southwestern Chicken Chopped Salad feel more like a meal, than “just” a salad. Carrots, $.99/lb: You need carrots throughout the meal plan this week, including the Spinach Salad, Green Salad, and Tortilla Soup. Figure out how many carrots are going in each dish, and you won’t have any leftover! Cucumber, 49¢/each: We’re splurging on a cucumber to help bulk up the green salads this week. While this is a great deal right now, I’d pay up to $1 for one cucumber if necessary. Garlic, 5 cloves: 79¢/6 oz: Not every ALDI has fresh garlic, so I went with the jarred minced garlic this time around. You’ll use it in the Tortilla Soup and Chicken Fried Rice. Feel free to use extra if you like a lot of garlic! Grape Tomatoes, $2.49/pint: These are the highlights of the salads this week, and cutting the tomatoes in half stretches them out a bit further than if you used them whole. Green Onions, $.79/bunch: The green part of the onion is great in Tortilla Soup and Baked Potato Nachos, but don’t let the white part go to waste! I suggest adding any extra to the hamburgers. You can also chop and freeze extra green onions and add them to soup or stir fry in the future for extra flavor. Iceberg Lettuce, $1.19/head: Any variety of lettuce will work in the meal plan, but I chose iceberg because it was on sale this week. If you find another variety or a pre-packaged mix that gives you just as much and costs less, feel free to go that route instead! You’ll want two heads of lettuce or two bags of salad mix. Onions, $1.79/2 lbs: You only need one yellow onion this week for Tortilla Soup and the Green Salads, but you can also slice one up for Hamburgers and BLTs too. Potatoes, $1.99/5 lbs: Russet potatoes are inexpensive year-round, so we’re using them in Baked Potato Nachos and as a side dish for the burgers. If you have extras, feel free to make Crispy Potato Wedges with the BLTs too! Spinach, $2.49/5 oz: Spinach is not cheap, but it’s very nutritious and a nice alternative to a typical Green Salad. My ALDI only had pre-packaged organic spinach, so your cost might be less depending on what your store offers. Tomato, $1.49/16 oz: You need one tomato in this meal plan, for Baked Potato Nachos and BLTs. My ALDI doesn’t sell large slicing tomatoes individually, so you might have extras. Use the Bonus Meal Ideas section below for ways to use them up! PRODUCE TOTAL: $17.28 TOTAL FOR ONE WEEK ALDI MEAL PLAN: $50.92 Not too shabby, eh? We’re coming in right at our target $50 budget with these Aldi recipes!

      "Kelley Sullivan March 8, 2024 at 10:13 PM Problem is these prices have nearly doubled since this meal plan was posted 3 years ago. Maybe you should update the prices to reflect this or make a disclaimer. I’d be lucky to have these items total less than $80. Just an FYI for future meal plan postings. I know you are very busy and may not have the time to do this. Thanks for putting this together and the meal ideas. Reply to this comment",
      "Brittany @ Team Crumbs March 9, 2024 at 9:40 AM Hello Kelley, The prices for this post have been updated as of March 2024. Your prices may vary depending on your area, but this meal plan should still be a frugal week of dinners for you. Reply to this comment",
      "Kristen March 18, 2022 at 9:33 AM Hi Tiffany, I would really love to buy your monthly meal plans that you used to provide (I’m a past customer and I loved having it all laid out for me!) I tried to purchase the year but it seems the site is down. How can I get these? Reply to this comment",
      "Karen @ Team Crumbs March 25, 2022 at 8:26 AM Hi Kristen, Please email [email protected] so we can help you figure out what meal planning service you previously had, and how you can get started again. Thank you! Reply to this comment",
      "HippieMomma March 1, 2022 at 8:14 PM I’d love to see an updated Aldi meal plan; with the inflation right now I can’t imagine some of these items currently being the prices they’re listed here. Reply to this comment",
      "Shawnee May 25, 2023 at 8:26 AM I totally agree. I really got a laugh out of the price of eggs. The cost listed for a dozen is close to the cost of one egg now. I’d be interested to see the updated cost as well. Reply to this comment"

      "One Week ALDI Recipes Meal Plan By Tiffany Published January 15, 2024 • Last Updated: January 15, 2024 6 Comments Using these ALDI recipes, you can feed a family of four for $75! This Aldi meal plan includes the slow cooker and Instant Pot, and even has ideas for using leftover ingredients to save more money! Who knew that when I published a $50 list of ALDI recipes, it would be one of the most popular posts on the blog?! I shouldn’t have been so surprised, since people love ALDI, people love eating real food, and people REALLY love saving money! My goal is to help you eat real food on a budget, so back by popular demand, let’s make another one-week Aldi meal plan! Before we get to the ALDI recipes, I want to mention a few other ways you can save money on food… Because while you CAN save money by making a meal plan, it’s when you combine that with strategies like shopping in bulk, cooking from scratch, and making a price book that you REALLY see the savings rack up. Psst! I actually teach you step-by-step how to do EXACTLY this ^^ so you can stop spinning your wheels with money-saving tips that just don’t work. My course Grocery Budget Bootcamp is more than tips – it’s a complete system that allows you to maximize your grocery savings every week while saving time and energy. Enrollment for the course is limited and opens just a couple of times a year, so join the waiting list here! Good news, you can join my FREE 5-day Crush Inflation Challenge and start saving money on groceries tomorrow! One final note if you’re new to shopping at ALDI…be sure to read my Ultimate Guide to Shopping at ALDI BEFORE you leave the house. ALDI is unlike the typical grocery store and has a few quirks that might catch you off-guard. Read this first, and then enjoy the savings! ONE WEEK ALDI MEAL PLAN INCLUDED IN THESE ALDI RECIPES: 100% real food recipes that are simple, straightforward, and family-friendly. Recipes that are quick to make and all of them can be made in under an hour. Easy from scratch staples to help cut costs, like no-knead artisan bread and hoagie rolls. Feel free to substitute store-bought if you prefer. A plan that comes in right around $75 for a family of four! NOT INCLUDED IN THE ALDI’S RECIPE LIST: Olive oil, vinegar, acids, spices, and pantry staples like baking powder are not included. These are things you likely already have in your pantry, and if you don’t have what the recipe calls for, you can easily swap it out with something you do have. Sweetener. This meal plan has just one recipe that calls for 1-2 tablespoons of sweetener and you really can use whatever sweetener you have…honey, maple syrup, and all variations of granulated sugar will work. And if you don’t have any, just leave it out! We’re always on a mission to quit sugar anyway, right? Precautions for food allergies. Two members of my family have sensitives to gluten, but we’re able to bypass those with gluten-free pasta and einkorn flour (which is traditional wheat that’s easier to digest – more on einkorn here). ALDI has a fantastic gluten-free line of foods, and if you’re dairy-free you probably have your favorite substitutes already. With a few tweaks, I think this Aldi meal plan would work in most food-allergy families too. NO BREAKFAST OR LUNCHES? This Aldi meal plan doesn’t include breakfast or lunches because, in my experience, most families have personal preferences on what they eat for breakfast and lunch. I have NO DOUBT the ingredients you buy for this meal plan will provide extras you can use to cover breakfasts and/or lunches. Here’s why: Every meal on this menu is something I have personally made for my family. Every single meal covers dinner for the four of us AND enough for at least one leftover lunch (usually two). Use the “Bonus Aldi Meal Ideas” section at the bottom to create your own breakfast and lunch menu. Those are just some ideas to get started, but they’re there to help you use the ingredients you’re already buying! If you still don’t think this is enough food to cover breakfast AND lunches, buy a bag of apples and a container of oatmeal. Make apple cinnamon oatmeal for breakfast and you’ll keep your bill under $80. 🙂 ALDI MEAL PLAN PRICES Prices for this Aldi meal plan were taken from an Aldi location outside of Atlanta just before publishing. The total cost in your area may be different!! I highly suggest… Shopping from your pantry first and substituting with as many things as possible where necessary to keep your shopping list as short as possible. Use your price book to find the rock-bottom prices in your area. Look at other stores like Walmart and Costco! I did side-by-side cost comparisons of ALDI vs. Walmart and ALDI vs. Costco and you might be surprised at what I found out! Remember, you’ll likely have extras of some ingredients! Use the Bonus Aldi Meal Ideas section below for ideas on additional recipes to make. ALDI RECIPES: WHAT TO BUY MEAT Whole Chicken: Most of our meat this week comes from two whole chickens. I included a recipe to cook in the slow cooker, but you can also roast in the oven or use your Instant Pot. Make sure to cook chicken stock with the bones! You need it later in the week for African Sweet Potato & Peanut Soup. Note: If you have chicken breast in the freezer, make this sheet pan chicken to shred up instead of buying more. Italian Sausage Links: You will use sausage links in Italian Sausage, Peppers, and Onions on Hoagie Rolls. Yum! Meat Total: $18.29 COLD CASE Milk: You need milk to make some of your side dishes this week. The total amount comes just under half a gallon. You can stick with that or buy a whole gallon if your family loves homemade cinnamon granola for breakfast. Butter: The Light and Fluffy Sweet Potato Biscuits NEED butter! It really makes those flakey layers stand out. Plus you’ll need it for your Hidden Veggie Mac & Cheese and Steamed Carrots. Eggs: Since eggs come in a dozen, you’ll have some extras. Use them for breakfasts or boiled eggs for lunch on the go. Cheddar Cheese: Cheese is typically cheaper (but not always!) when you buy it in a block and shred it yourself. Feel free to go the block route or buy already shredded. Feta Cheese: Don’t skip the feta on the Stuffed Baked Sweet Potatoes. This topping makes the dish! Cold Case Total: $12.75 PANTRY Beans: Beans are a perfect cheap protein to add to meals. The shopping list calls for a can of beans but you can buy dry beans if you prefer (in the long run, dry beans are cheaper than canned beans!). Make them in the slow cooker or Instant Pot, then divide them into 1 ½ cup portions and freeze extras. One 15 oz can of black beans is about equal to 1 ½ cups of cooked beans. Kalamata Olives: I love the flavor of kalamata olives, but if you like black olives better go right ahead (plus you’ll save $1). Olives round out the flavor of the Stuffed Baked Sweet Potatoes. Pasta: Homemade Hidden Veggie Mac & Cheese is the best comfort food! Go with the traditional elbow pasta or mix it up with any other small pasta. Peanut Butter: You probably want to go with creamy peanut butter this time. You need it for the dressing on the Loaded Kale Salad and in the African Sweet Potato & Peanut Soup. Peanuts: Dry-roasted peanuts are your best bet for topping the Loaded Kale Salad and you need them for the African Sweet Potato & Peanut Soup too. Pumpkin: Canned pumpkin is the hidden veggie in Hidden Veggie Mac & Cheese. It’s an amazing way to add some extra nutrients! Rice: The recipes for these Aldi meals call for white rice. Feel free to use brown rice if that’s what you already have at home. I love to cook big batches in the Instant Pot and freeze them for later. Tikka Masala: This is an unusual ingredient, but it has clean ingredients and I wanted to give you a super quick and easy meal for your busiest night. Pair a jar with shredded chicken and leftover rice and BOOM! Dinner! Pantry Total: $17.35 PRODUCE Avocado: This healthy fat is a great addition to any salad. Loaded Kale Salad is no exception! Bell Peppers: You need yellow and green peppers for Italian Sausage, Peppers, and Onions. If you can’t find them individually at your ALDI, buy one package of mixed peppers – or even all green bell peppers – and substitute as needed. Butternut Squash: One of your side dishes is Roasted Butternut Squash. Feel free to substitute any other winter squash or really any vegetable that’s on sale this week. For conventional produce, aim for $1 per pound. For organic produce, aim for $2 per pound. Cabbage: You need cabbage for Roasted Cabbage Wedges and Egg Roll in a Bowl. Both are delicious ways to use this inexpensive vegetable! Carrots: The recipes use about two pounds of carrots. I like to buy whole carrots and peel and cut myself, but you can use baby carrots if you want, and especially if they’re on sale! Celery: You only need a little bit of celery in Egg Roll in a Bowl. Use the rest for snacks or lunches. Celery sticks dipped in Homemade Ranch or Hummus are a favorite in our house or have the classic celery and peanut butter! Cilantro: Hands down, cilantro is one of my favorite herbs (hello Cilantro Lime Slaw and Magic Thai Peanut Sauce!) If you don’t love it, gasp you can skip it. It tops the African Sweet Potato & Peanut Soup. Garlic: This is a kitchen staple that you need for a few dishes. Fresh garlic really adds so much flavor! Kale: This leafy green is the star of the show in Loaded Kale Salad. Plus, you use it in the Stuffed Baked Sweet Potatoes. Mushrooms: You need about 4 ounces of mushrooms in the Egg Roll in a Bowl. You can use any extra for stir fry or maybe even add them to the Italian Sausage, Peppers, and Onions! Onions: Onions are part of the main dish in Italian Sausage, Pepper, and Onions. But you also need them in Egg Roll in a Bowl, African Sweet Potato & Peanut Soup! Russet Potatoes: Potatoes are going in the Loaded Kale Salad. Don’t knock it until you try it! I didn’t think roasted potatoes in a salad would be good, but WOW! Sweet Potatoes: Sweet potatoes are the main component of Stuffed Baked Sweet Potatoes. Make sure to bake an extra one that night to have it ready for Sweet Potato Biscuits. Spinach: I really like kale, but mixing up the salad greens with spinach helps you vary the nutrients! Add these to the Stuffed Baked Sweet Potatoes. Cherry Tomatoes: Cherry tomatoes (a.k.a. grape tomatoes) go on top of your Loaded Kale Salad and get roasted for your Stuffed Baked Sweet Potatoes. I’m telling you; these meals are delicious! Tomatoes: The African Sweet Potato & Peanut Soup gets a handful of tomatoes. This helps thicken up the soup and adds great flavor! Produce Total: $27.20 TOTAL FOR ONE WEEK OF ALDI MEALS: $75.59 ALDI RECIPES FOR DINNER: Now that you’ve got your ingredients nailed down, these are the ALDI recipes we’ll be making: MEAL 1: Whole Chicken // Roasted Cabbage Wedges // Hidden Veggie Mac & Cheese // Roasted Butternut Squash MEAL 2: Stuffed Baked Sweet Potatoes // Fried Eggs MEAL 3: Loaded Kale Salad // Sweet Potato Biscuits MEAL 4: Tikka Masala Chicken over Rice // Mixed Mashed Potatoes // Steamed Carrots MEAL 5: African Sweet Potato & Peanut Soup // No-Knead Overnight Artisan Bread MEAL 6: Sheet Pan Sausage, Onions, & Peppers // Hidden Veggie Mac & Cheese // Hoagie Rolls MEAL 7: Egg Roll in a Bowl Psst!

Here are some bonus Aldi recipes to use up those items, keeping your grocery bill even lower! Peanut Butter Sandwiches – use leftover homemade buns and peanut butter. Greek Pasta Salad – use extra pasta, kalamata olives, and this Homemade Greek Salad Dressing. Add any leftover feta, tomatoes, kale, spinach, and mushrooms too. Fried Rice – use extra eggs, extra rice, soy sauce, and any leftover vegetables you might have (there will likely be leftover bell pepper, carrots, celery, garlic, mushrooms, and onion). If you have some, add leftover shredded chicken or sausage too. Add extra peanuts for crunch. Biscuits – homemade biscuits need just flour, baking powder, salt, butter, and milk. And/or Buttermilk Biscuits – If you use some apple cider vinegar to make Homemade Buttermilk, you can have buttermilk biscuits! And/or Pumpkin Biscuits – Use my sweet potato biscuit recipe but substitute leftover pumpkin for the sweet potato. Pancakes – use extra eggs, flour, baking powder, milk, and butter to make Light and Fluffy Pancakes. Top with honey or fruit if you don’t have maple syrup. NEED MORE MEAL PLANS?

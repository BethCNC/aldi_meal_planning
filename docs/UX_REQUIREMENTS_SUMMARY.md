# Aldi Meal Planner UX Requirements Summary

## Strategic Insight
- Core problem is meal-related decision paralysis driven by ADHD/Autism/ARFID; automation must eliminate choice overload and anxiety triggers.
- System should deliver fully decided weekly plans the user can approve, not options to choose from.
- Success equals reduced weekly spend ($100 target), fast weekly planning (<10 min), and ongoing anxiety relief.

## User Journey Targets
- Sunday: Review auto-generated plan, generate grocery list, finish within 10 minutes.
- Weekdays: Follow daily dinner assignments with minimal effort; clear indication of "today" in UI.
- Weekends: Built-in leftover night and guilt-free takeout allowance.
- Continuous: Maintain peace of mind knowing dinners are already decided.

## Interaction Principles
- Decision-free flow: automation selects recipes, enforces budget, and publishes plan.
- Predictable routine: consistent weekly cadence, familiar meal rotation, standardized layouts.
- Cognitive load minimization: single-column layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal text, one primary action per screen.
- Completion dopamine: pervasive checkboxes and status states for plan/shopping progress.
- Anxiety mitigation: upfront cost/time estimates, explicit permission for deviations, no hidden surprises.

## Data & Content Requirements
- Safe recipe library of 25+ vetted meals with cost-per-serving, familiarity tags, and prep times.
- Ingredient catalog with Aldi pricing, categorized by in-store layout for list grouping.
- Weekly plan database that captures day-to-recipe assignments, total spend, and status.
- Grocery lists grouped by store zones with aggregate quantities and estimated totals.

## Automation Expectations
- Weekly generator chooses six dinners + leftover + flexible day, balancing protein variety and cost.
- Budget enforcement swaps out costly meals until total fits target.
- Grocery list builder consolidates ingredient quantities, converts to package counts, and groups by aisle.
- Price maintenance workflow updates ingredient costs and recalculates recipe totals quickly.

## Accessibility & Neurodivergent Support
- Clear "today" indicators, bold headings, minimal scrolling, linear instructions.
- Ingredient checklists and step-by-step cooking guidance with time markers.
- Built-in notes for prep tips, leftovers, and reminders to reduce executive load.

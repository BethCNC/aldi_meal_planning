# Aldi Meal Planner: UX Research & Pain Points Summary

## The Core Discovery: Reframing the Problem

The foundational UX insight that shaped this entire project: **The real problem isn't "meal planning"—it's decision paralysis caused by ADHD/Autism/ARFID that leads to expensive takeout and constant anxiety.**

This reframe transformed the project from a traditional "meal planning tool" into an **anxiety reduction + decision automation system**.

---

## Primary Pain Points Identified

### 1. Decision Paralysis (The Central Issue)
- Daily 6pm trigger: "What's for dinner?" creates complete shutdown
- Can't think of any "safe" meals in the moment
- Overwhelmed by choices, even with ingredients available
- Executive dysfunction prevents starting to cook
- Partner provides no input, leaving all decisions on one person

### 2. Constant Background Anxiety
- Low-level stress: "What will I eat today?"
- Sunday dread: "I should meal plan this week"
- Avoidance behavior because planning feels too overwhelming
- Guilt cycle: spend → shame → vague intentions → repeat

### 3. Financial Hemorrhaging
- **Current state:** $200/week on food (groceries + takeout)
- ~$120-160/week specifically on impulse DoorDash orders
- $30-40 per takeout order, 4-5x/week
- Food waste from poor planning compounds the cost
- **Target:** $100-120/week total

### 4. Food Waste & Poor Nutrition
- Groceries spoil because there's no plan to use them
- Takeout-heavy diet impacts health
- Inconsistent eating patterns
- Shame about "failing" to cook despite having ingredients

---

## Research Methodology

**Self-Research Approach** (Solo product designer studying own behavior):
- Current state analysis documenting the anxiety cycle
- Behavioral pattern mapping across a typical week
- Financial tracking of spending patterns
- Honest assessment of triggers and avoidance behaviors
- Context gathering: household dynamics, time constraints, food preferences

---

## Key User Insights

### Behavioral Patterns
- **No meal planning currently happens** (complete avoidance)
- **Wait until last minute** → order DoorDash becomes the default
- **Sunday intentions** never materialize into action
- **Both picky eaters** with ARFID considerations
- **1 hour maximum** available for weeknight cooking

### The Breakthrough Insight
> **"I need decisions removed entirely, not just organized."**

Traditional meal planning tools organize information and present choices. This user needs the system to **decide for them**—providing a plan to review and approve, not options to choose from.

---

## Design Principles Derived from Research

### Core Principles for ADHD/Neurodivergent Users

#### 1. Remove decisions, don't organize them
- System decides, user approves
- No browsing recipe libraries
- Automation over configuration

#### 2. Reduce cognitive load
- Single-column layouts
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Minimal text, maximum clarity
- One primary action per screen

#### 3. Provide structure and routine
- Consistent weekly format (same process every Sunday)
- Predictable meal rotation
- Built-in flexibility (leftover/order-out nights)

#### 4. Satisfy completion drive
- Checkboxes everywhere for dopamine hits
- Status indicators showing progress
- Clear endpoints

#### 5. Eliminate anxiety triggers
- Show costs upfront (no surprises at checkout)
- Include time estimates (manage expectations)
- Give permission to deviate (Sunday order-out night is planned)

---

## Success Metrics Defined

### Quantitative
- **Weekly budget:** $100/week target (50% cost reduction from $200)
- **Planning time:** Maximum 1 hour/week → **10 minutes/week** (85% time reduction)
- **3-month goal:** Under $150/week total food spending

### Qualitative
- Eliminate constant food-related anxiety
- Remove daily decision-making burden
- Stop impulse takeout ordering
- Reduce food waste
- Build confidence and sense of control

## User Journey Transformation

### Before: The Anxiety Cycle

```
Sunday
├── Anxiety: "I should meal plan this week"
├── Avoidance: Too overwhelming to start
└── Outcome: No plan made

Monday Evening (6pm, hungry)
├── Trigger: Need to decide what's for dinner
├── Decision paralysis: 
│   ├── Don't know what's in the fridge
│   ├── Don't know what partner wants
│   ├── Can't think of any "safe" meals
│   └── Cooking feels too hard without a plan
├── Executive dysfunction: Can't start cooking
└── Outcome: Order DoorDash ($30-40)

Tuesday-Friday
└── Repeat Monday's cycle ($120-160 on takeout)

Saturday
├── Guilt about spending/waste
├── Vague intention to "do better next week"
└── Cycle repeats

Background (constant):
└── Low-level anxiety: "What will I eat today?"
```

**Impact:**
- Financial: ~$200/week
- Mental: Constant background stress
- Health: Poor nutrition from takeout
- Emotional: Shame/guilt about "failing" to cook

---

### After: The Automated System

```
Sunday Morning (10 minutes)
├── Open Notion: "Aldi Meal Planner"
├── System already generated this week's plan
├── Review: 
│   ├── 5 dinners (familiar recipes)
│   ├── 2 "leftover/easy" nights
│   └── Total cost: $95
├── Quick scan: "Yep, I can do this"
├── Click: "Generate Grocery List"
├── Print list or save to phone
└── Done. Zero decisions made.

Monday Morning (30 minutes)
├── Go to Aldi
├── Follow list (organized by store layout)
├── Everything costs exactly what system predicted
└── Done. Come home, put away groceries.

Monday Evening (6pm, hungry)
├── No decision needed—system says: "Chicken stir-fry tonight"
├── Open recipe in Notion
├── Follow steps (ingredients already prepped)
├── Cook for 30-40 minutes
└── Eat. No stress, no takeout.

Tuesday-Friday
└── Repeat: Check plan, cook meal, no decisions

Saturday
├── Leftover night (planned)
└── Zero guilt, system working

Background (constant):
└── Peace: "I already know what's for dinner"
```

**Expected Results:**
- Financial: $100-120/week (40-50% reduction)
- Mental: No meal-related anxiety
- Health: Home-cooked, consistent meals
- Emotional: Confidence, sense of control

- **Automation design:** Decision-making algorithm that respects constraints
- **Data modeling:** Normalized ingredients, calculated costs, linked recipes

### Accessibility Awareness
- **Neurodivergent-first design:** Specific accommodations for executive dysfunction
- **Cognitive load reduction:** Single-column layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal text
- **Completion mechanics:** Leveraging checkbox dopamine for engagement

### Measurable Outcomes
- **50% cost reduction** ($200 → $100/week)
- **85% time reduction** (1 hour → 10 minutes planning)
- **Anxiety elimination** (constant stress → peace of mind)

## The UX Research Lesson

### What Made This Research Valuable

Traditional user research might have accepted "I need help meal planning" at face value and built a recipe organizer. 

**Deep behavioral analysis revealed:**
- The user already knows how to meal plan (skill isn't the problem)
- The user has recipes saved (information isn't the problem)
- **Decision-making itself is the barrier** (executive function is the problem)

This insight fundamentally changed the product strategy:
- ❌ Don't build: Recipe discovery tool, ingredient filters, manual planning interface
- ✅ Do build: Automated decision engine, review-and-approve flow, anxiety-reduction system

---

## Next Steps & Validation

### Phase 1: Build & Test (Weeks 1-2)
- Implement Notion databases with formulas
- Create automation for plan generation
- Test with real shopping trips and cooking

### Phase 2: Measure Impact (Weeks 3-8)
- Track weekly spending (target: <$120)
- Track planning time (target: <10 min)
- Qualitative anxiety assessment (journal entries)

### Phase 3: Iterate & Refine (Weeks 9-12)
- Identify edge cases and failure modes
- Optimize recipe rotation algorithm
- Improve grocery list organization

### Phase 4: Document for Portfolio (Week 13+)
- Create visual journey maps
- Design information architecture diagrams
- Write case study with before/after metrics
- Reflect on lessons learned

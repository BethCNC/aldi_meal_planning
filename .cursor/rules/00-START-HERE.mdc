## 🎯 What You're Building

**A meal planning app that**:
- Asks ONE question: "How many days?"
- Makes ALL decisions automatically
- Delivers a print-ready grocery list in 30 seconds
- Reduces weekly food spending from $200 → $100
- Eliminates decision paralysis for neurodivergent users

**Why it matters**:
- Traditional apps fail because they assume users CAN decide
- This app removes decisions entirely, not just organizes them
- Portfolio-worthy UX case study demonstrating systematic design thinking

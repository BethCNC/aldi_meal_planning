## 🚀 How to Get All Files

### Option 1: I'll Create Key Files Here
Let me know which specific documents you want me to create first in this folder, and I'll add them one by one.

**Most important to start with**:
- 01-problem-definition.md
- 02-design-principles.md
- 07-implementation-roadmap.md
- QUICK-REFERENCE.md

### Option 2: Download from Summary
I can provide you with the key content in a single comprehensive document that you can reference.

## 🎯 Quick Project Overview

### The Problem
Neurodivergent users experience decision paralysis when meal planning. Traditional apps fail because they assume users CAN make decisions when presented with organized options.

### The Solution
A conversational AI agent that:
- Asks ONE question: "How many days?"
- Makes ALL decisions automatically  
- Delivers ready-to-print grocery list in 30 seconds
- Eliminates 15+ decision points → just 1

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Time to complete | 30 min | 30 sec | **97% faster** |
| Decisions required | 15-20 | 1 | **95% fewer** |
| Completion rate | 10% | 95% | **85% increase** |
| Anxiety level | 8/10 | 2/10 | **75% reduction** |
| Weekly spending | $200 | $100 | **50% savings** |

## 🎨 Design Principles

1. **Automation Over Customization** - Make decisions FOR users, not WITH them
2. **Accessibility-First** - WCAG AAA, triple input modality (voice/button/text)
3. **Single-Screen Flow** - No navigation, no tabs, vertical scroll only
4. **Instant Value** - Grocery list first, details second
5. **Graceful Degradation** - Works even if components fail

## 🎯 Key Insights

### 1. Decision Fatigue is Cumulative
Each decision point adds cognitive load. By recipe selection (decision #5), users are exhausted.

### 2. Choice Overload Causes Paralysis
50 recipes = 0 recipes chosen. Too many options = no action.

### 3. Perfectionism Prevents Completion
Users want the "perfect" plan but can't achieve it, so they abandon.

### 4. Time Investment Creates Anxiety
After 15 minutes, users feel committed but overwhelmed. Sunk cost fallacy + decision fatigue = abandonment.

### 5. Lack of Guidance Increases Uncertainty
No AI, no suggestions, no "this is good for you" → users feel lost.

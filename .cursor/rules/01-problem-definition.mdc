# 01 - Problem Definition

**Why This Project Exists**

---

## 🎯 Core Problem Statement

**Neurodivergent users experience decision paralysis when meal planning, causing them to abandon the process entirely or default to expensive takeout.**

Traditional meal planning apps fail because they assume users **CAN** make decisions when presented with organized options. This app removes decisions entirely, not just organizes them.

## 📊 The Data

### Current State Metrics (Traditional Apps)

| Metric | Value | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Completion rate** | 10% | 90% of users abandon |
| **Time to complete** | 30+ minutes | Too long, causes anxiety |
| **Decisions required** | 15-20 per session | Decision fatigue |
| **Anxiety level** | 8/10 | High stress, avoidance |
| **Weekly food spending** | $200+ | Default to takeout |

### Target State Metrics (This App)

| Metric | Target | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Completion rate** | 95% | **85% increase** |
| **Time to complete** | 30 seconds | **97% faster** |
| **Decisions required** | 1 (days only) | **95% reduction** |
| **Anxiety level** | 2/10 | **75% reduction** |
| **Weekly food spending** | $100 | **50% savings** |

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why Traditional Apps Fail

#### 1. **Decision Overload**
Traditional apps present 10-20 recipes and ask users to:
- Choose which recipes they like
- Select days for each meal
- Adjust serving sizes
- Customize ingredients
- Set dietary preferences
- Review and approve

**Result**: 15-20 decision points → decision paralysis → abandonment

#### 2. **Assumption of Capability**
Apps assume users can:
- Compare multiple options simultaneously
- Make quick decisions
- Plan ahead mentally
- Organize information in their head

**Reality**: Neurodivergent users need:
- One decision at a time
- Automatic organization
- Visual confirmation
- Reduced cognitive load

#### 3. **Customization Paradox**
More options = more flexibility, but also:
- More decisions required
- More cognitive load
- More anxiety
- Lower completion rates

**Solution**: Automation over customization

## ✅ Success Criteria

### Primary Metrics

1. **Completion Rate**: 95% of users complete meal plan generation
2. **Time to Value**: Grocery list ready in < 30 seconds
3. **Decision Reduction**: From 15-20 decisions → 1 decision
4. **Cost Savings**: Average weekly spending reduced by 50%
5. **User Satisfaction**: Anxiety level reduced from 8/10 → 2/10

### Secondary Metrics

- Return usage rate (weekly active users)
- Recipe variety (no repeats within 2 weeks)
- Grocery list accuracy (all ingredients available at Aldi)
- Print success rate (users successfully print grocery list)

# 02 - Design Principles

**How to Make Decisions**

These five principles guide every design and development choice. When in doubt, refer to these principles.

## 🎯 Principle 1: Automation Over Customization

**Make decisions FOR users, not WITH them.**

### What It Means
- The app makes all choices automatically
- Users only answer: "How many days?"
- No recipe selection, no day assignment, no ingredient swaps
- AI agent handles all decision-making

### Why It Matters
- Reduces decision fatigue (15-20 decisions → 1)
- Eliminates choice paralysis
- Faster completion (30 sec vs 30 min)
- Higher success rate (95% vs 10%)

### Implementation Examples
✅ **DO**: AI selects recipes based on variety, cost, and preferences  
✅ **DO**: Automatically assign meals to days  
✅ **DO**: Generate complete grocery list  
❌ **DON'T**: Ask "Which recipes do you want?"  
❌ **DON'T**: Show recipe cards for selection  
❌ **DON'T**: Require manual day assignment

### When to Break This Rule
- User explicitly requests a change (e.g., "I don't like chicken")
- Accessibility requires alternative input method
- Error recovery (e.g., ingredient unavailable)

## ♿ Principle 2: Accessibility-First

**WCAG AAA compliance, triple input modality, zero barriers.**

### What It Means
- **WCAG AAA** compliance (not just AA)
- **Triple input modality**: Voice, button, text
- **Keyboard navigation** for all interactions
- **Screen reader** optimized
- **High contrast** mode available
- **Reduced motion** support

### Why It Matters
- Neurodivergent users often have multiple accessibility needs
- Voice input reduces typing barriers
- Keyboard navigation supports motor disabilities
- High contrast helps visual processing

### Implementation Examples
✅ **DO**: Every action has voice, button, and keyboard shortcut  
✅ **DO**: All text has 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum  
✅ **DO**: Focus indicators visible and clear  
✅ **DO**: ARIA labels on all interactive elements  
❌ **DON'T**: Rely on color alone for information  
❌ **DON'T**: Auto-play animations  
❌ **DON'T**: Require mouse/touch for core functions

### When to Break This Rule
Never. Accessibility is non-negotiable.

## 📱 Principle 3: Single-Screen Flow

**No navigation, no tabs, vertical scroll only.**

### What It Means
- One screen, one purpose
- Vertical scroll for content
- No hamburger menus
- No tab navigation
- No back buttons
- Progressive disclosure (show more as needed)

### Why It Matters
- Reduces cognitive load
- Eliminates navigation decisions
- Clearer mental model
- Faster task completion
- Less overwhelming

### Implementation Examples
✅ **DO**: All content on one page, scroll down  
✅ **DO**: Show grocery list immediately after generation  
✅ **DO**: Expand details on click/tap  
❌ **DON'T**: Multiple pages or routes  
❌ **DON'T**: Tab navigation  
❌ **DON'T**: Modal overlays for core content

### When to Break This Rule
- Print view (separate optimized layout)
- Error states (temporary overlay)
- Settings (minimal, rarely accessed)

---

## ⚡ Principle 4: Instant Value

**Grocery list first, details second.**

### What It Means
- Show grocery list immediately after generation
- Recipe details are secondary
- Print button prominent
- Total cost visible upfront
- Minimal loading states

### Why It Matters
- Users want the list, not the process
- Faster time to value (30 seconds)
- Reduces anxiety (see results quickly)
- Builds confidence (immediate success)

### Implementation Examples
✅ **DO**: Show grocery list as soon as it's ready  
✅ **DO**: Print button at top of list  
✅ **DO**: Total cost prominently displayed  
✅ **DO**: Recipe details expandable, not default  
❌ **DON'T**: Show "generating..." for more than 2 seconds  
❌ **DON'T**: Hide grocery list behind tabs  
❌ **DON'T**: Require scrolling to see total cost

### When to Break This Rule
- First-time user onboarding (brief explanation)
- Error states (need to explain what went wrong)

---

## 🛡️ Principle 5: Graceful Degradation

**Works even if components fail.**

### What It Means
- App functions if AI fails (fallback recipes)
- Works without voice input (button/text always available)
- Functions offline (cached recipes)
- Handles API errors gracefully
- No single point of failure

### Why It Matters
- Reliability builds trust
- Reduces anxiety about failures
- Supports users with unreliable internet
- Professional, polished experience

### Implementation Examples
✅ **DO**: Fallback to pre-selected recipes if AI fails  
✅ **DO**: Cache recipes locally  
✅ **DO**: Show error message, suggest retry  
✅ **DO**: Voice input optional, not required  
❌ **DON'T**: Show blank screen on error  
❌ **DON'T**: Require internet for core functions  
❌ **DON'T**: Crash if one component fails

### When to Break This Rule
- Critical security issues (must fail securely)
- Data corruption (must prevent, not degrade)

## 🎨 Applying Principles Together

### Example: DaysSelector Component

**Principle 1 (Automation)**: Auto-selects 7 days as default  
**Principle 2 (Accessibility)**: Voice input, keyboard shortcuts, screen reader labels  
**Principle 3 (Single-Screen)**: Inline on main page, no modal  
**Principle 4 (Instant Value)**: Shows immediately, no loading  
**Principle 5 (Graceful Degradation)**: Works without voice, fallback to buttons

### Example: Grocery List Display

**Principle 1 (Automation)**: Auto-generated, no manual editing  
**Principle 2 (Accessibility)**: Print-optimized, high contrast, keyboard accessible  
**Principle 3 (Single-Screen)**: Same page, scroll to see  
**Principle 4 (Instant Value)**: Shown immediately after generation  
**Principle 5 (Graceful Degradation)**: Cached if API fails, shows last generated list

## 🤔 Decision Framework

When making any design or development decision, ask:

1. **Does this automate a decision?** (Principle 1)
2. **Is this accessible to all users?** (Principle 2)
3. **Does this keep everything on one screen?** (Principle 3)
4. **Does this provide value immediately?** (Principle 4)
5. **Does this work if something fails?** (Principle 5)

If the answer to all 5 is "yes" → ✅ Proceed  
If any answer is "no" → 🤔 Reconsider or justify exception
